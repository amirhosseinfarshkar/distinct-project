My SQL Story: Discovering Unique Ages Over 30
During a data project with a big employee dataset, I needed to find out how many employees were over 30 and what their unique ages were. This is where I really got to practice using SQL to filter and clean data efficiently.

At first, I pulled out all the different ages to see the variety, but with so many records, I wanted to focus only on those older than 30 to get a clearer picture. Instead of jumping straight to complex group filters, I remembered that it’s better to filter the raw data first — so I used a simple condition to narrow down the ages before doing anything else.

This small but smart step helped me speed up my analysis and gave me more accurate insights. It was a great reminder that understanding the basics well — like how and when to filter data — can make a huge difference in any project.
